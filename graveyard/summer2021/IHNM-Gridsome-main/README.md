# Welcome! Here is hosted the source code of IHNM website

The website itself is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)'s servers and available at https://ihnm.netlify.app.

## About
IHNM is a static website created as a hobby project.
I do not make a living by programming but I am having so much fun doing it.
The website is about user-friendly interface, interactivity, functionality and fun.
Thus:
* There is no place for ads
* UI is created based on the essence of the page not the existing components
* Results should not keep user waiting. "Click to calculate" buttons should not exist

## Technologies used:
* [Vue.js 2.6](https://vuejs.org) - JavaScript Framework
* [Gridsome 0.7](https://gridsome.org/) - static site generator
* [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS preprocessor
* [Vue I18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/) - internationalization plugin
* [bignumber.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js) by [MikeMcl](https://github.com/MikeMcl) helps with converting numbers into different systems at [number-systems](https://ihnm.netlify.app/ru/number-systems) page

## Help the project
